Learning from scratch is harder than you might imagine—I didn’t even know what Kahoot was until recently! But here I am, trying to figure it all out.

This repository reflects my learning journey. You’ll find errors, fixes, and progress, because that’s how learning works: by doing, breaking things, and fixing them again.

Thanks for stopping by!
